An automatic answer checker application that checks and marks written answers similar to a human being. This software application is built to check subjective answers in an online examination and allocate marks to the user after verifying the answer. The system requires you to store the original answer for the system. This facility is provided to the admin. The admin may insert questions and respective subjective answers in the system. These answers are stored as notepad files. When a user takes the test he is provided with questions and area to type his answers. Once the user enters his/her answers the system then compares this answer to original answer written in database and allocates marks accordingly. Both the answers need not be exactly same word to word. The system consists if in build artificial intelligence sensors that verify answers and allocate marks accordingly as good as a human being.
