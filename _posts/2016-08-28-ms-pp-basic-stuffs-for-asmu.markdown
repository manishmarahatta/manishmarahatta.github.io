<h1>Transition</h1><br>
A transition is how PowerPoint gets from one slide to the next during an 
onscreen slide show. The normal way to segue from slide to slide is simply 
cutting to the new slide — effective, yes, but also boring. PowerPoint enables 
you to assign any of the more than 50 different special effects to each slide 
transition. For example, you can have the next slide scoot over the top of the 
current slide from any direction, or you can have the current slide scoot off 
the screen in any direction to reveal the next slide. You can have slides fade 
out, dissolve into each other, open up like Venetian blinds, or spin in like 
spokes on a wheel.<br>
<br>
1. Move to the slide to which you want to apply the transition.<br>
Note that the transition applies when you come to the slide you apply 
the transition to, not when you go to the next slide. For example, if you 
apply a transition to slide 3, the transition is displayed when you move 
from slide 2 to slide 3, not when you move from slide 3 to slide 4.<br>
2. Select the transition you want to apply from the Transition to This 
Slide section of the Transitions Ribbon tab.<br>
If you want, you can display the complete gallery of transition effects by 
clicking the More button at the bottom right of the mini-gallery of transi-
tion effects displayed within the Ribbon. Figure 10-2 shows the complete 
Transitions gallery.<br>
3. Use the Effect Options drop-down list to select a variation of the transi-
tion effect you selected in Step 2.<br>
The available variations depend on the transition you’ve chosen.<br>
4.  If you want, use the Sound drop-down list to apply a sound effect.<br>
The Sound drop-down list lists a collection of standard transition 
sounds.<br>
5.  Use the Duration drop-down list to control how fast the transition 
should proceed.<br>
The default is 1 second, but you can specify a slower or faster speed if 
you want.<br>
6.  Use the On Mouse Click or After options to indicate how the transition 
should be triggered<br>
  If you want to control the pace of the slide show yourself, select the On 
Mouse Click check box. Then, the slide will remain visible until you click 
the mouse. If you want the slide to advance automatically after a delay, 
select the After check box and specify the time delay.<br>
